liblockfile (1.09)

  * Update path to full license in the COPYRIGHT file
    (Anibal Monsalve Salazar)
  * Remove debug code from lockfile_create():
     The lockfile_create-function still contains some debug code, which
     considers a lock stale after 10 seconds instead of 5 minutes. As
     the documentation suggests refreshing the lock every 60 seconds,
     programs might lose the lock unexpectedly. Found while researching
     debian bug #505278. (Wolfram Sang <w.sang@pengutronix.de>)
  * Updated dotlockfile manpage and updated dotlockfile usage message.
    Fixes debian bug 493462 (Roland Eggner <edvd1@systemanalysen.net>)
  * Change 'ar' in Makefile.in to '$(AR)' (for cross builds).
    Fixes debian bug 562937 (Wolfram Sang <wsa@pengutronix.de>)
  * Clean up temporary lockfile if lockfile(1) was interrupted.
  * dotlockfile now also allows you to create a lockfile in
    a group-writable-by-one-of-your-auxilary-groups directory
  * dotlockfile: -r-1 now retries indefinitely (well, 4000 years)
  * remove ppsh macro in dotlockfile.1, replace with standard .SH

liblockfile (1.08)

  * When not writing a pid into the lockfile, write "0\n" as
    placeholder instead of "0\0" (bug reported by Rob Browning
    <rlb@defaultvalue.org>)
  * lockfile_check() did the following:
      - open lockfile
      - read from it
      - stat file and get atime as 'now'
    this gets the 'now' time from the filesystem so comparisations
    to mtime work even if the clock of the remote file server is off.
    However this doesn't work with noatime / relatime, so now we stat
    the lockfile both before and after the read and use atime only
    if it differs before and after.
  * Copy Changelog from debian/changelog now that the package
    isn't native anymore since 1.07
